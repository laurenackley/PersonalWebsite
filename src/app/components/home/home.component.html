        <p>For my Midterm Project at Skill Distillery I was on a team with 3 other people. We created a website where one can create journal entries for beverages they have tried, specifically beer, wine and liquor. <br>
          <br>
          We created the web application using JSPs. On the backend we used Java, JPQL, Spring, and JPA. On this project I was the DBA and I created it using MySQL workbench.

          For my Final Project at Skill Distillery I was on a team with 3 other people and we made a Asynchronous JavaScript and XML application called Skill Swap. It is an app meant for people to be able to post the DIY projects that they want to do but need help with connect to those who can help.
          <br>
          On this application we used Angular, TypeScript, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS for the front-end. On the back-end we used Java, Springboot, JPA, and Postman to test the end points.
          <br>
          On this application we added encrypted passwords using Spring Security and saved it as a string so the password is saved raw and able to be viewed form the terminal.
          <br>
          What I really enjoyed about this project was that we used a lot of bootstrap to really make the application pop, in my opinion.<br>
